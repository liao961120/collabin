Some commentators viewed the incident as Russian retaliation for a WADA report that detailed Moscow-sanctioned efforts to provide performance-enhancing drugs to Russian athletes during the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics.

The United States, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom issued statements attributing the incident to Russian military intelligence.

"Compromise of the Democratic National Committee",2016-06-14,"This incident is believed to be the work of APT 28. The Dukes were also found to be in the Democratic National Committee's networks.","In June 2016, suspected Russian threat actors were discovered in the networks of the U.S. Democratic National Committee (DNC). Intruders gained access to its research on Republican presidential candidate Donald J. Trump and emails and correspondences among DNC officials. Over the course of the presidential campaign, the threat actors released DNC correspondence through intermediaries such as WikiLeaks, revealing information about infighting among top party officials and leading to the resignation of the DNC chair. The threat actors also went after John Podesta, chairman of Hillary Clinton’s campaign, and released more embarrassing data throughout the summer.

The secretary of homeland security and the director of national intelligence released a joint statement asserting that the protracted cyber espionage campaign was the work of Russian actors. The Barack Obama administration subsequently sanctioned Russian intelligence officials and deported suspected officers working in the United States. The DNC compromise is believed to be part of a larger Russian espionage campaign waged for the purpose of manipulating the electoral systems in Western democracies and undermining faith in the democratic process in the United States, France, Germany, and elsewhere.

In July 2018, the U.S. Department of Justice indicted twelve officials of the Russian military intelligence agency, known as GRU, believed to have been responsible for this incident.

The group, which FireEye called APT 1, is a unit within China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) that has been linked to a wide range of cyber operations targeting U.S. private sector entities for espionage purposes. The comprehensive report detailed evidence connecting APT 1 and the PLA, offered insight into APT 1’s operational malware and methodologies, and provided timelines of the espionage it conducted.

FireEye termed Unit 61398 “APT 1” to indicate that the threat actor was an Advanced Persistent Threat, a type of operation in which the goal of the network intrusion is not only to gain access to a server or system, but also to retain ongoing access and engage in protracted cyber operations. The APT 1 report exposed the infrastructure of a cyber threat actor and gave both government and nongovernment organizations insight into the escalating nature of state-sponsored cyber operations.","Criminal charges   https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-charges-five-chinese-military-hackers-cyber-espionage-against-us-corporations-and-labor","United States, United Kingdom, Switzerland, Taiwan, Singapore, Canada, Israel, India, France, Norway, Belgium, Luxembourg, United Arab Emirates, South Africa, Japan",China,Espionage,"Private sector, Government",https://web.archive.org/web/20130219155150/http://intelreport.mandiant.com/Mandiant_APT1_Report.pdf,http://www.mcafee.com/us/resources/white-papers/wp-operation-shady-rat.pdf,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/19/technology/chinas-army-is-seen-as-tied-to-hacking-against-us.html

Attackers flooded bank servers with junk traffic, preventing users from online banking. An Iranian group called Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Cyber Fighters initially claimed responsibility for the incident. At the time, the media reported that U.S. intelligence believed the denial of service was in response to U.S. imposed economic sanctions to counter Iran’s nuclear program. Seven Iranian individuals linked to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps were eventually indicted by the U.S. Department of Justice in 2016 for their involvement in the incident. 

The denial of service attacks against U.S. banks is significant for two reasons. First, the size and scale of the attacks led the State Department to seek other countries’ assistance in taking down the compromised computers that were flooding the banks with junk traffic. Second, the attacks would indicate that Iran—if it was in fact using the attacks as retaliation for U.S. financial sanctions—was acting proportionally in its dispute with the United States.","Criminal charges   https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/seven-iranians-working-islamic-revolutionary-guard-corps-affiliated-entities-charged","Bank of America, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, US Bancorp, PNC, Capital One, Fifth Third Bank, BB&T, HSBC","Iran (Islamic Republic of)","Denial of service","Private sector",http://pastebin.com/mCHia4W5,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/09/technology/online-banking-attacks-were-work-of-iran-us-officials-say.html,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/iran-blamed-for-cyberattacks/2012/09/21/afbe2be4-0412-11e2-9b24-ff730c7f6312_story.html

The fallout from the cyberattack caused DigiNotar to file for bankruptcy, as it was no longer considered a reliable provider for digital security certificates.

The threat actors conducted a phishing campaign that compromised the networks of Yahoo, Adobe, Dow Chemical, Morgan Stanley, Google, and more than two dozen other companies to steal their trade secrets. Google was the only company that confirmed it was a victim and disclosed to the public that the Gmail accounts of certain Chinese human rights activists had been compromised. Google also publicly attributed the incident to China, something companies were reluctant to do for fear of jeopardizing their access to the Chinese market.  

The incident is viewed as a milestone in the recent history of cyber operations because it raised the profile of cyber operations as a tool for industrial espionage. It led Google to cease its operations in China, though it continues to operate a localized version of its search engine in Hong Kong. As a result of the Gmail compromise, Google began notifying users if it believed their accounts had been targeted or compromised by a state-sponsored actor. This practice later spread to other email providers.","Denouncement   http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/22/world/asia/22diplo.html","Google, Adobe, Juniper Networks, Rackspace, Yahoo, Symantec, Northtrop Grumman, Morgan Stanley, Dow Chemical",China,Espionage,"Private sector",http://www.wired.com/2010/01/operation-aurora/,https://web.archive.org/web/20160417132538/https://kc.mcafee.com/resources/sites/MCAFEE/content/live/CORP_KNOWLEDGEBASE/67000/KB67957/en_US/Combating%20Threats%20-%20Operation%20Aurora.pdf,http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/13/AR2010011300359.html

Stuxnet was the first publicly known instance in which a cyber operation caused physical damage outside of a controlled testing environment. It demonstrated the potential effectiveness and value of a cyber weapon. Many experts and former government officials feared that the attack on Natanz would open the door to other states conducting destructive cyberattacks and Stuxnet would represent, in the words of former Director of the National Security Agency Michael Hayden, a moment when “somebody crossed the Rubicon.” However, nation-states have so far exercised restraint.","Denouncement   http://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-nuclear-stuxnet-idUSTRE73G0NB20110417","Iran, Indonesia, India, Azerbaijan, Pakistan, Malaysia, United States, Uzbekistan, Russia, United Kingdom, South Korea, Taiwan","Israel, United States",Sabotage,Military,http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/w32stuxnet-network-information,http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-11388018,"http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2369745,00.asp"
